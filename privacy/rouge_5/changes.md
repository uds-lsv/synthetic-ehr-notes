The `util.py` and `rouge_similarity_ranking.py` files are from the [mdpi2021-textgen](https://github.com/nedap/mdpi2021-textgen/tree/main/textgen/evaluation) repository. The `rouge_similarity_ranking.py` was adapted to load JSON files storing the medical note in an output field of each document as used in this study. No other changes were made and the evaluation files were newly created for the purpose of this study.
