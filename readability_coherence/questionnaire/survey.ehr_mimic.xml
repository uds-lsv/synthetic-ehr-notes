<![CDATA[Thanks for showing interest in this study and supporting my research :) 

The following user study is going to be part of the evaluation of the research project I am currently conducting for my Master Thesis at Stockholm University under the supervision of Dr. Hercules Dalianis and Dr. Dietrich Klakow. We are trying to build powerful clinical models by using different Natural Language Processing methods and large clinical datasets. To take part in this study, you are required to have medical expertise on a professional level. The study is fully anonymous and your answers will only be used in the scope of this research project. 

You should plan about 30 minutes to carry out the study. Before continuing, please answer the following questions. ]]>

<p>CT Head: 1. No evidence of acute fracture or acute intracranial process on noncontrast CT head. 2. Additional findings as described above. </p>
<p>CT C spine: Multilevel degenerative changes without acute fracture or traumatic malalignment. </p>
<p>Chest X ray: Moderate right pleural effusion with right base density which is suspicious for sequela of aspiration or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  RUQUS ___ : Cholelithiasis without sonogram evidence of acute cholecystitis.  TTE ___ : Suboptimal image quality no parasternal or suprasternal views obtained. Overall normal LV Systolic function. At least moderate to severe, possibly severe mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. At least moderate pulmonary hypertension. Trace aortic regurgitation. Compared with the prior TTE images reviewed of ___ severity of MR has increased significantly. PASP higher 52 .  Renal US ___ : 1. Extremely limited study secondary to patient inability to cooperate breath hold. As such, intrarenal artery waveforms are suboptimal and poorly evaluated. The right main renal artery is grossly patent. The left main renal artery is not definitely seen. 2. Bilateral cortical thinning is compatible with medicorenal disease. No evidence of hydronephrosis.  CXR ___ : Comparison to ___. Stable extent of the small left pleural effusion. Decrease of the previously moderate and now small right pleural effusion. Stable mild cardiomegaly. Today's radiograph shows no evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumonia. No pneumothorax. </p>
<p>MICROBIOLOGY: Blood culture x 2: negative Urine culture: contaminated C. diff PCR: negative  </p>
<p>Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure:</p>
<p>Mitral Regurgitation:</p>
<p>Systemic Hypertension: Pulmonary Hypertension likely Type II : Patient presented with breathing difficulties and hypoxia. EKGs and cardiac biomarkers wee not consistent with ischemia. Admission CXR with bilateral pleural effusions and subsequent CTA torso was without evidence of PE or aneurysm, but did demonstrate mild peribronchial thickening in the lower lobes and GGOs. There was initial concern for pneumonia and she was treated with zosyn. TTE subsequently demonstrated new moderate to severe mitral regurgitation although possibly underestimated ___ MAC with preserved LV function and PASP of 52. Given lack of other signs of pneumonia antibiotics were stopped and patient remained stable. She was subsequently diuresed with improvement in her respiratory status and oxygenation. She was noted to be very hypertensive, and in the context of severe MR her blood pressure was aggressively controlled. She was eventually stabilized on a regimen of lisinopril and nifedipine, as well as furosemide. A renal US was a poor study but did not demonstrate arterial stenosis there was no other lab evidence to support a diagnosis of secondary hypertension. Peribronchial thickening on CT was concerning for chronic aspiration, and although her initial SLP evals were poor, she eventually was able to advance to a regular diet without modifications on repeat assessments. Patient will follow up with her PCP and cardiologist. Her blood pressures, electrolytes and creatinine will need to be monitored closely as an outpatient.  Dementia: has 24 hour home aides at bedside. She was maintained on delirium precautions. Although she was intermittently more confused through her hospital stay, by the end of her course her mental status was at baseline according to her aides and family.  Recent fall: Patient had experienced a fall in the days weeks prior to admission. She underwent trauma evaluation in the ED with CT head and neck without traumatic or acute changes. CT torso without evidence of rib fractures. ___ evaluated patient, and after serial evaluations, was recommended as safe to return to her prior living situation with 24 hour care.  Hypothyroidism: TSH WNL. Home levothyroxine was continued.  Pulmonary nodules: CT scan incidentally demonstrated multiple pulmonary nodules. No follow up was specifically recommended for this finding. </p>
<p>TRANSITIONS OF CARE  Follow up: Patient will follow up with her PCP and cardiologist. Her blood pressures, electrolytes and creatinine will need to be monitored closely as an outpatient. Patient has new diagnosis of moderate severe mitral regurgitation, which may require further follow up with her cardiologist. Discharge weight was 47.04 kg 103.7 lb .  Code: DNR DNI, confirmed by admitting MD</p>
<p>Contact: ___ ___ or ___ daughter vacationing ___ ___, grandaughter  Time spent coordinating discharge 30 minutes    </p>
<p>Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  </p>

The original serology testing was sent soon after fevers started, so IgM would not have developed. PCR is recommended for early testing within 3 weeks of start of symptoms . Original evaluation for Lyme Western Blot, Babesia, UA UCx, CXR, Influenza had been negative. Patient had normal colonoscopy in ___. LENIs without VTE. TTE showed a non mobile echobright spot thought most likely to be calcium. Blood cultures remained negative. He lacked other features or risks of Q fever. No attacks of abdominal or joint pain suggestive of familial Mediterranean fever. Repeat Lyme IgM was positive, but this is most likely cross reactivity with anaplasmosis commonly seen, B. miyamotoi is transmitted by the same Ixodes tick that transmits Lyme and Anaplasma . When his liver enzymes started rising viral hepatitis studies were also sent. His heterophile test returned reactive. ID was consulted whether this represented true infection infectious mononucleosis or EBV hepatitis, but they felt it was likely a false positive in the setting of alternative infxn, which has been documented in other settings Dengue fever, ___: ___ CMV, ___: ___ Babesia, ___: ___ Malaria, ___: ___. RUQ Doppler showed patent hepatic vasculature and normal echotexture. His Tbili and INR normalized, but his ALT and AST remain elevated at the time of discharge. This is most likely from anaplasmosis, but recheck should be obtained on ___ to ensure resolution. CMV and quant gold are pending at the time of discharge, but now that anaplasma was discovered and the patient has markedly improved, the clinical suspicion for other infections is low. Continue doxycycline 100 mg BID for 10 days total through ___. Instructed on technique to prevent pill esophagitis Dimenhydrinate 1 hr prior to doxy may be used to help prevent upset stomach  Transitional issues Hepatitis B vaccination not protected on serology Re check labs on ___  Mr. ___ was seen and examined on the day of discharge and is clinically stable for discharge today.

<p>History of Present Illness: ___ w hx HTN, OSA on home O2 , GERD, IBD, OA s p L R TKR ___ ___ w R knee redo ___ c b PNA, respiratory failure requiring intubation, readmission for hypotension and PNA. More recently, ___ L knee ER IIIB hardware infection ___ c b gout flare ___ </p>
<p>Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:  On POD 1, patient was hypotensive and had episodes of desaturation. Patient was placed on 15L FM. He was given 1 unit of blood. Oxycodone was resumed for pain control. Labs were sent and the Medicine team was consulted. His Urinalysis was positive for WBCs without bacteria. He was given 1 tablet of Cipro.  On POD 2, the Medicine team transfered the patient to medicine. They recommended adding 40mg IV Lasix as boluses for 20 hours. The Orthopaedic surgery service has discontinued Vancomycin and Gabapentin since he does not have a hardware infection and the gabapentin may be causing his hypoxia. The patient was unable to get Lasix due to blood pressures. They touched base with the patient's PCP regarding his blood pressures and PCP stated that it is reassuring that his blood pressures are as robust as they are given the fact that he was very hypotensive immediately post op with intubation and resuscitation. They recommended keeping patient NPO until urine output adequate.  On POD 3, Medicine team is going to have f u plasma and urine lytes in the morning to evaluate his response to fluids and blood pressures. IP team talked to medicine resident recommending TTE with CO2 to evaluate for difference in pulmonary artery pressures present or absent . They are also working on a liquid diet to re start tomorrow morning. Medicine team c s to see if Dr. ___ would perform TTE once OOB to evaluate for shunt versus PNA once transfer back from ___ to medicine service. Patient was transferred to Medicine service for further care management.  On POD 4, medicine team added amlodipine 5mg PO and decreased oxycodone to 5mg 10mg per pain level. Medicine team requested interventional pulmonary consult and he was ordered a V Q scan. He had two episodes of nausea vomiting in the early morning but cleared to floor status.  On POD 5, he had a V Q scan that showed intermediate probability of PE. He was placed on lovenox 90mg SC BID for 6 weeks for treatment of provoked PE. Medicine team discontinued oxycodone 10mg Q4 PRN, lack of significant change in O2 sat on current dose. They placed him on Lasix 20mg PO daily given signif fluid overload on CXR and hypoxemia. They also recommended considering if he will need a longer term antihysterensive regimen for his new HTN and did discontinue zofran as it was not used in several days and has a QT prolonging effect.  On POD 6, the patient worked with ___ and he was cleared for discharge to rehab. His lovenox was discontinued as well as his foley due to turning events. He began having sx of constipation and his bowel regimen was increased.  On POD 7, he was hemodynamically stable for discharge.  On POD 8, he was ready for rehab but had to wait for insurance endorsement to be given to rehab.  On POD 9, patient was given a bed at rehab at ___.  Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure Hypotension Chronic pulmonary Edema Aspiration Pneumonia vs RVR Medicine followed him daily and helped manage his care. Initial Medicine recommendations included giving 40mg IV Lasix boluses on POD 2 as blood pressure allowed. Per Medicine team discussion with the patient's PCP, it was acceptable that blood pressures are robust given the intubation fluid resuscitation post operative hypotension . Given this information, medical team decided to start Torsemide 10mg PO daily on POD 5 for diuresis and Lasix was discontinued. Lasix 20mg PO daily can be given if pt has a 1lb weight gain.  He was continued on prednisone 40mg for 7 days and 5 more days after completing 7 days on 40mg daily. After completing 5 total days on prednisone, he can be placed on Pred 10mg daily for 4 more days to help prevent adrenal crisis post steroids via taper on POD 14. Medicine recommended keeping O2 sats above 90 and this was continued on discharge.  Intermittent doses of Hydromorphone 0.25mg PO 0.5mg Q4 PRN for pain management was continued on discharge  On POD 6, his Cipro was discontinued. On discharge, his oxy was changed from 5mg BID for 1 day then daily dosing. If needed to taper oxy, can be given oxycodone 5mg daily for 1 day and then can be tapered by 5mg with additional PO Tylenol for pain management as tolerated.  In regards to his Zofran use, it was discontinued on POD 5 because it was not needed and has a QT prolonging effect.  On day of discharge, patient was tolerating his diet. He was ambulatory and voiding independently.  Nursing endorsed that ___ was working with patient and he felt he was ambulating well in the halls and rehab was recommended.
